I.

generated ssl certificate to folder /etc/nginx/certificate (linked to ./certificate)
modified nginx config to https and ports in compose.yaml

ssl certificate:
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
-keyout /path/to/nginx/certs/selfsigned.key \
-out /path/to/nginx/certs/selfsigned.crt

2 volumes (in /home/login/data)

in wordpress:
volumes:
      - wordpress_data:/var/www/html
and in nginx:
volumes:
	- wordpress_data:/usr/share/nginx/html

III.

dockerfiles - create 3 dockerfiles with one line FROM

Connecting to mariadb:
inside docker container:
# mariadb -u USER -p
if port 3306 is exposed:
# mysql -h localhost -P 3306 --protocol=tcp -u root -p

Steps for the info:
# SHOW DATABASES;
# USE exampledb;
# SHOW TABLES;
# [wordpress needs to be set up]

wordpress usernames - with env variables in compose.yaml



TODO.
domain name
.env for environment vars
docker secrets
VM
volumes in /home/login/data of the host machine

Read about PID 1 and the best practices for writing Dockerfiles.
